"Leah Mendelson grew up in Owego, New York, down the road from where IBM was founded, surrounded by engineering companies like Lockheed Martin, whose outreach insured they were well-known at local schools. Itâ€™s no wonder she went on to study mechanical engineering. But the tie to her interest in fluid mechanics? Mendelson notes her many years as a competitive swimmer." - hmc.edu

"Price, who joined the HMC staff in fall 2019, instructs students on design techniques, oversees projects and ensures that students and faculty members learn the correct techniques to safely use equipment in the machine shop, now located adjacent to the new makerspace in the Scott A. McGregor Computer Science Center." - hmc.edu
