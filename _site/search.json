    "text": "Jason Bowman\nEngineering major at Harvey Mudd College (grad 25), with experience in embedded systems, electrical engineering, control systems, DSP, electromechanical systems, and mechanical design.\n\n\n\nMechanical design was my first engineering interest when entering Harvey Mudd College. Although I was ultimately drawn to the realm of electrical and embedded systems, mechanical design has always remained one of my top three interests in engineering. I love working with my hands, learning new things, and seeing a final product come together through the countless twists and turns of the design process.\n\n  🔗 LinkedIn     👤 Jason’s Personal Website     📄 Resume  \n\n\n\n\nLarry (Gengyan) Liu\nI’m a senior Physics major at Pomona College with extensive experience in mechanical design, fluid dynamics research, and innovative engineering projects. From designing a tracked electric platform with two-speed transmission to simulating and experimenting vortex ring formation in Sphagnum moss, I’ve pursued my passion for creating sophisticated mechanical systems throughout my undergraduate career.\n\n\n\nMy journey in mechanical design began in my freshman year, driven by a deep fascination with designing and building functional mechanical systems. Though I wish I had formal mechanical design education earlier, the self-taught path has given me unique perspectives and problem-solving approaches. My work spans from non planar superconducting stellarator magnets to amphibious robots and shaped charge simulations, reflecting my diverse interests in applied physics and engineering.\nFuture Plans: I’m excited to continue my academic journey as a Kummer I&E Doctoral Fellow at Missouri S&T, where I’ll advance research in energetic materials safety and applications.\n\n  🔗 LinkedIn  \n\n\n\n\nNebiyu Samuel\nI’m a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in engineering, with a strong interest in mechanical design and hands-on fabrication.\n\n\n\nI enjoy working in both the metal and wood shops, where I apply practical skills to bring ideas to life. I’m especially passionate about projects that combine technical precision with creative problem-solving.\n\n  🔗 LinkedIn     📄 Resume"

It’s no wonder she went on to study mechanical engineering. But the tie to her interest in fluid mechanics? Mendelson notes her many years as a competitive swimmer.” - hmc.edu\n\n\n\n\n“Price, who joined the HMC staff in fall 2019, instructs students on design techniques, oversees projects and ensures that students and faculty members learn the correct techniques to safely use equipment in the machine shop, now located adjacent to the new makerspace in the Scott A. McGregor Computer Science Center.” - hmc.edu"
