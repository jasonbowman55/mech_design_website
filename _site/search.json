Although I was ultimately drawn to the realm of electrical and embedded systems, mechanical design has always remained one of my top three interests in engineering. I love working with my hands, learning new things, and seeing a final product come together through the countless twists and turns of the design process.\n\n  üîó LinkedIn     üë§ Jason‚Äôs Personal Website     üìÑ Resume  \n\n\n\n\nLarry (Gengyan) Liu\nI‚Äôm a senior Physics major at Pomona College with extensive experience in mechanical design, fluid dynamics research, and innovative engineering projects. From designing a tracked electric platform with two-speed transmission to simulating and experimenting vortex ring formation in Sphagnum moss, I‚Äôve pursued my passion for creating sophisticated mechanical systems throughout my undergraduate career.\n\n\n\nMy journey in mechanical design began in my freshman year, driven by a deep fascination with designing and building functional mechanical systems. Though I wish I had formal mechanical design education earlier, the self-taught path has given me unique perspectives and problem-solving approaches. My work spans from non planar superconducting stellarator magnets to amphibious robots and shaped charge simulations, reflecting my diverse interests in applied physics and engineering.\nFuture Plans: I‚Äôm excited to continue my academic journey as a Kummer I&E Doctoral Fellow at Missouri S&T, where I‚Äôll advance research in energetic materials safety and applications.\n\n  üîó LinkedIn  \n\n\n\n\nNebiyu Samuel\nI‚Äôm a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in engineering, with a strong interest in mechanical design and hands-on fabrication.\n\n\n\nI enjoy working in both the metal and wood shops, where I apply practical skills to bring ideas to life.
