title: "Ideation"
---
With inspiration originally derived from the Strandbeest Bike video titled [Epic Cycling | Truly Unique Bicycle that Walks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXXJ1LOqHEk) on YouTube, created by [Brandon Green at the Dallas Makerspace](https://talk.dallasmakerspace.org/t/rogue-strandbeest-mk2-build-complete/49518), this project aims to extend the concept to an electromechanical system capable of supporting the weight of a couch and a passenger.

This idea was further explored by [Nebiyu Samuel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nebiyu-samuel-262214256/) and [Scarlett Bonner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scarlett-bonner/) in [E175: Dynamics of Rigid Bodies](https://catalog.hmc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=7786) at Harvey Mudd College, taught by [Professor Lori Bassman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lori-bassman-2229285/). In their report titled "Modeling a Strandbeest Bike" found at the bottom of this page, Nebiyu and Scarlett drew from knowledge learned in E175 to analyze footpath, kinetic energy, and power requirements needed to run this complex mechanical system.

It is important to note that while our design was inspired by previous work with the Jansen linkage like seen in the bike image, we instead take advantage of specific weight-bearing properties from the Carpentopod design shown and linked below.
