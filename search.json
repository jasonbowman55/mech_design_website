    "text": "Jason Bowman\nEngineering major at Harvey Mudd College (grad 25), with experience in embedded systems, electrical engineering, control systems, DSP, electromechanical systems, and mechanical design.\n\n\n\nMechanical design was my first engineering interest when entering Harvey Mudd College. Although I was ultimately drawn to the realm of electrical and embedded systems, mechanical design has always remained one of my top three interests in engineering. I love working with my hands, learning new things, and seeing a final product come together through the countless twists and turns of the design process.\n\n  üîó LinkedIn     üë§ Jason‚Äôs Personal Website     üìÑ Resume  \n\n\n\n\nLarry (Gengyan) Liu\nI‚Äôm a senior Physics major at Pomona College with extensive experience in mechanical design, fluid dynamics research, and innovative engineering projects. From designing a tracked electric platform with two-speed transmission to simulating and experimenting vortex ring formation in Sphagnum moss, I‚Äôve pursued my passion for creating sophisticated mechanical systems throughout my undergraduate career.\n\n\n\nMy journey in mechanical design began in my freshman year, driven by a deep fascination with designing and building functional mechanical systems. Though I wish I had formal mechanical design education earlier, the self-taught path has given me unique perspectives and problem-solving approaches. My work spans from non planar superconducting stellarator magnets to amphibious robots and shaped charge simulations, reflecting my diverse interests in applied physics and engineering.\nFuture Plans: I‚Äôm excited to continue my academic journey as a Kummer I&E Doctoral Fellow at Missouri S&T, where I‚Äôll advance research in energetic materials safety and applications.\n\n  üîó LinkedIn  \n\n\n\n\nNebiyu Samuel\nI‚Äôm a senior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in engineering, with a strong interest in mechanical design and hands-on fabrication.\n\n\n\nI enjoy working in both the metal and wood shops, where I apply practical skills to bring ideas to life.

    "text": "Crankshaft\nThis design allows us to transfer torque from the reduction stage into the legs. Our initial plan was to use 12 total legs‚Äîthree at each corner‚Äîwhich required either a long crankshaft, simulated below, or numerous sprockets and chains. The simulation highlighted key issues in our design.\n\n\n\nSolidWorks FEA Simulation for Crankshaft\n\n\nThe long crankshaft introduced undesirable failure modes and increased design complexity, while the sprockets and chains exceeded our budget. Based on the simulation, we made two key decisions that ultimately contributed to the success of our project.\n\nDecision 1:\nWe moved from 12 legs to 8 legs, with only 2 per corner, reducing the length of the crankshaft and decreasing the localized torque experienced near the crankshaft‚Äôs sprocket.\n\n\nDecision 2:\nWe increased the thickness of the steel bars used for the crankshaft to reduce the risk of torsional failure modes that may have been overlooked in the idealized simulation."

    "text": "Legs\nThe legs were manufactured from 3/4-inch wooden cutouts using the ShopBot machine in the Harvey Mudd machine shop. Each leg accounted for both slipping and non-slipping joints, with either bushing carriages (shown below) or secure bolts mounted accordingly. In total, we fabricated eight legs.\n\n\n\nBushing assembly used for rotational joints on the legs\n\n\nIn addition to the bolt and bushing connections, one more connection was required to complete the leg assemblies. As seen below, 3D-printed spacers, a generous amount of 5-minute epoxy, and six wood screws were used to clamp these sections‚Äîoptimized to withstand the expected shear forces.\n\n\n\nGlued and screwed section of our leg assembly\n\n\nDue to the compactness of our design and the hardware available at Harvey Mudd College, the previously 4-inch-long, 1/2-inch-diameter bolts were cut nearly flush with each joint to prevent interference within the assembly, as seen on the right in the image of the finished legs below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúBrackets‚Äù\nThe components we refer to as brackets serve as mounting points for the axle and fixed sections of the crankshaft connected to the frame. The assembly features a dual bearing design using 1/2-inch steel rods, 1-inch steel tubing, and 3/4-inch square beams. A complete bracket assembly is shown below, including bearing placement and a 3D-printed spacer that keeps the bearings near the tubing edge to maximize resistance to bending moments. Specific dimensions are available in the CAD ZIP file linked on the homepage.\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring proper alignment during bracket assembly is crucial, as they support long 1/2-inch steel beams that serve as crankshaft mounts and axle blocks. Extreme care was taken using bearings, 1/2-inch steel rods, long bolts, clamps, and scrap 80/20 bars as guides to achieve precise alignment across all brackets as shown below.\n\n\n\nDIY aligment fixture\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nThe frame refers to the top portion of the full assembly, where the couch mounts above and the motor and reduction assemblies mount below. Four 3-foot-long angle irons were welded into a square, with 80/20 bars screwed in parallel along two sides. An additional four 80/20 bars were attached to the top, serving as mounting points for the couch, motor, and reduction stages. This configuration provides flexibility in positioning the motor and reduction assemblies, allowing for proper spring tensioning during final assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction Stage\nAs determined in the Design & Simulation section, a total gear reduction of 16:1 is required. Since each motor drives two pairs of legs (front and back on one side), the reduction must be achieved in two stages. The reduction stage shown below represents the first step. A key feature of this component is that it converts a single input (the large gear) into two outputs (the smaller gears), with one driving the front legs and the other driving the back legs on the same side of the walking couch.\n\n\n\n\nThe pillow blocks in this design are made from 100% infill PLA 3D-printed material and include press-fit bearings. The shaft features three sprockets and a range of differently sized spacers, visible between the sprockets in the image above and below. These spacers provide flexibility during the assembly process.\n\n\n\n\nCouch\nWe used Dominick‚Äôs college futon, which was originally slightly too long. To adapt it, we shortened it to approximately 3 feet wide while preserving its ability to recline‚Äîa critical feature. After all, when riding a walking couch across a college campus, one must be sufficiently reclined to truly convey just how cool they really are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Design\nIT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE LARRY WRITE UP A SHORT SCHEMATIC FOR THE ELECTRICAL STUFF WITH PART NUMBERS ETC\n\n\n\nThe Trials and Tribulations of E177\n\n\nLarry fired up the waterjet bright,\nDominick vowed to guard it right.\nBut slumber came and took its claim‚Äî\nHe drifted off mid-jetting flame.\n\nAndrew stepped in, alert and spry,\nBut heavy lids soon dimmed his eye.\nHe too gave in, began to snore‚Äî\nAnother watcher lost to lore.\n\nThen Jason passed, with camera quick,\nHe snapped the scene‚Äîhis timing slick.\nA moment framed in drowsy lore:\nTwo napping techs, the jet did roar.\n\nChat GPT\n\n\n\n\nA slight miscalculation turned into more welding practice."
