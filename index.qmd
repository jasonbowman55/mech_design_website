Welcome to our final project for Mechanical Design, a course at Harvey Mudd College focused on mechanical principles, analysis techniques, group design workflows, and product development.

# Introduction
This project focuses on the physical design, analysis, and implementation of an electromechanical Jansen linkage system capable of carrying a couch and passenger, allowing for stylish transport around Harvey Mudd's campus. Further information about technical specifics and design decisions can be found in the tabs at the top of the page.

# Stretch Goals
<ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <li>Move 5 mph</li>
  <li>Hold 2 people</li>
  <li>Able to navigate hallways of Harvey Mudd</li>
  <li>&lt;70 dB</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
# Future Work
<ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <li>Upgrade to 12 legs for smoother movement enabled by a 120° phase offset (currently 180°)</li>
  <li>Decrease gear ratio to achieve higher speeds</li>
  <li>Replace bushings in leg joints with ball bearings to extend operating lifetime</li>
  <li>Add an enclosure for electronics and chain linkage</li>
</ul>
</div>

# Conclusion
While some of our design specifications and requirements were not met, the contraption did walk! As seen in the video below, the mechanism was able to walk under its own weight using the specified motor and leg assembly. Chain tension and alignment were challenges for the team and could definitely be improved in future designs.
