Welcome to our final project for Mechanical Design, a course at Harvey Mudd College focused on mechanical principles, analysis techniques, group design workflows, and product development.

This project focuses on the physical design, analysis, and implementation of an electromechanical Jansen linkage system capable of carrying a couch and passenger, allowing for stylish transport around Harvey Mudd's campus. Further information about technical specifics and design decisions can be found in the tabs above.
